We don't know yet. But modelling is in my opinion a useful tool to investigate potential effects. 
Therefore, I used Gavin Andresen's mining simulator to create some more or less plausible scenarios. 
You can find the [resulting plots on github](https://github.com/jonasnick/bitcoin_miningsim/blob/master/analysis/README.md).
