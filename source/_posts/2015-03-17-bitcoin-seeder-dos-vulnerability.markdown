The DNS parser of the [Bitcoin Seeder](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder) was vulnerable to a denial of service attack. A specially crafted DNS request could trigger infinite recursive function calls that lead to a stack overflow. See the [exploit](https://gist.github.com/jonasnick/62558e4b8ab43bc847c2).
The vulnerability was fixed in commit [11e935b](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder/commit/11e935b72020607e5c3ce85a88209bc34e427a06).
