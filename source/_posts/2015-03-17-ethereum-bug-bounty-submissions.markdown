I found two vulnerabilities in the crypto currency [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org): [negative transactions](https://github.com/jonasnick/eth-neg-value-tx) and [predictable ECDSA nonce](https://github.com/jonasnick/ecdsaPredictableNonce/). 

As part of the [bug bounty program](https://bounty.ethdev.com/) I was awarded with 20 Bitcoin.
