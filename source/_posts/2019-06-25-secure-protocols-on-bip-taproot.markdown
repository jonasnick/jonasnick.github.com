At [Breaking Bitcoin](https://breaking-bitcoin.com/) 2019 in Amsterdam I gave a talk about how to build secure protocols on BIP-taproot or more specifically how to avoid the dangers we learned about so far.
There was not enough time to cover everything.
The talk also gives an introduction to how to use our [MuSig implementation in libsecp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/secp256k1-zkp/include/secp256k1_musig.h).
The video recording is on [youtube](https://youtu.be/DKOG0BQMmmg?t=21866) ([slides](/slides/2019-breaking.pdf)).
Thanks to [kanzure](https://twitter.com/kanzure) there's also a [transcript](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/) of the talk.
