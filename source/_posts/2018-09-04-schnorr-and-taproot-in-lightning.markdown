Last weekend a bunch of hackers assembled for the 3rd Lightning Netword Hackday in Berlin.
The event was packed with interesting sessions, neat hacks and exciting discussions which were concluded with the traditional dinner & drinks at ROOM77.
I gave a talk about "Schnorr and Taproot in Lightning" ([slides](/slides/2018-hackday.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrX1SpD6l9g&feature=youtu.be&t=7524)) focusing on privacy and security implications.
