Relation to Neuroscience
---------------

Mexican hat (Difference of Gaussians) receptive fields are found in retinal ganglion cells and the LGN. 
They vary with respect to their polarity (on-center vs. off-center). 
Orientation specific receptive fields (Gabor filters) are found throughout the cortex. 
Complex cells react equally well to step edges and lines.
